      The elephant is a large mammal of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. 
      Three species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, 
      and the Asian elephant. Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, 
      and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; 
      other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, 
      and mastodons.
