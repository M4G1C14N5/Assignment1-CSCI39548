        The giant panda, also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, 
        is a bear native to south central China. It is easily recognized by 
        the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, 
        and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to 
        distinguish it from the unrelated red panda. Though it belongs to the 
        order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo.
