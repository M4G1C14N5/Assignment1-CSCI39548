            The tiger is the largest cat species, reaching a total body length of up to 3.38 m (11.1 ft) over curves and 
            weighing up to 388.7 kg (857 lb) in the wild. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer 
            and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of 
            habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother 
            for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own. 
            As of 2007, the tiger population was estimated at 3,062–3,948 in the wild, down from 100,000–200,000 in 1900. 
            This is likely due to habitat loss and poaching, as well as human encroachment into the tiger's domain. 
            The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It featured prominently 
            in ancient mythology and folklore, and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature. The tiger is the 
            national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and South Korea.
